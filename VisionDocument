MATLAB Marina Mobile Website Vision Document

Date: September 1, 2015


Introduction

The Armstrong MATLAB Marina website serves as an online resource for students taking Engineering courses that require the use of MATLAB programming language and associated software. It introduces basic to advanced programming concepts for engineering students, offering video tutorials, example programs, and exercises. The Marina Mobile Redesign Project aims to improve the experience of students accessing Marina on a handheld mobile device (smartphone or tablet).


Business Needs/Requirements

The current MATLAB Marina website is difficult to navigate on smartphones and tablets, as it was designed without these different media in mind. The use of handheld mobile devices to access online content has eclipsed the use of large-screened devices like laptops and desktop computers, prompting the need for online content to be easily accessible from handheld devices, and the Marina website is no exception. Students accessing the current Marina website are met with difficulties navigating the menus and reading the text, among other issues.  


Product/Solution Overview

The Marina website will be redesigned to make it responsive to varying screen sizes. The new website will offer one unified experience between large- and small-screen devices, granting students access to the content on their terms.

The new website will feature a simplified navigation menu, which can be toggled in and out of view on mobile devices where screen width is restricted. It will also scale content to appear appropriately sized on smaller screens. The redesigned layout of each page will ensure that critical content remains at the fore when screen size is limited, while non-critical content will be hidden or pushed to the bottom of the document. 

 
Scope & Limitations

The content of the website will remain as it is. The layout of the content and the navigation system will be modified to create a responsive experience. 


Accessibility

The website will be accessible from all modern mobile and desktop/laptop web browsers.
